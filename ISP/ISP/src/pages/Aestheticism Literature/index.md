Welcome to this post about aestheticism literature. We are going to discuss three different forms of texts which are written by one brilliant writer.

## What is Aestheticism? 

There are many different types of aestheticism, but here we are introducing the one which is an artistic movement during the 19th century. Aestheticism has one simple idea:
> ## Art for art's sake 

The follower of aestheticism is called <b>"aesthete"</b> <br/>
They believe that the only purpose of creating art is to serve its enjoyment.<br/>
It sounds fair enough. However, now we are introducing other terms: 
### Victorian era & Fin De Siècle

The victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria's reign, from 1837 to 1901. Fin De Siècle means "the end of the century" in french. Becasue of the background of Victorian fin de siècle (The combination of Victorian era & Fin De Siècle), aestheticism is a pretty revolutionary idea. <br/>

The reason is that the entire Victorian era is about self-improvement. With the rise of the middle class and aristocracy, the Victorians believed industriousness and commitment were all young people need to succeed in Europe. The idea of aestheticism is opposite from their opinion because aestheticism rejects "improving art".

## When did aestheticism start?
Aestheticism was built upon the idea from late 18th-century German Romantic philosophers. They believed that "art's value lies not in its usefulness but its beauty and in the pleasure it gives."Aestheticism originated in 1860s England with a radical group of artists and designers, including William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.<br/>

## Oscar Wilde

My all three texts are written by Oscar Wilde. He was one of the most popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is also the most famous aesthete becuase of his well known novel and scripts. If you go back to the top of the article and look at the picturem you can see the person is actually Oscar Wilde.

## The Picture of Dorian Gray
![](https://i.imgur.com/X9G49bi.png =100x100)

This <b>novel</b> was published in the July 1890. It is the most famous novel which is about aestheticism. It is also recognized as a classic of gothic literature. The novel shows how Dorian Gray was enthralled by the aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. From here, we can see the evidence of Aestheticism element. Dorian Gray has a paint which shows his beauty. He exchanges his soul to the person in the picture, so all the changes of him will show on the picture instead of him in real life. Dorian Gray was temped by Lord Henry, and while he fell into the hedonistism, his soul becomes a ugly monster in the paint. In fact, Wilde said that
>"[The Picture of Dorian Gray] contains much of me in it — Basil Hallward is what I think I am; Lord Henry, what the world thinks me; Dorian is what I would like to be — in other ages, perhaps." - Wilde,1894

The novel also has allusions on Faust. In both the legend of Faust and in The Picture of Dorian Gray a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. And in the chapter 5 of the novel, it says 

>"He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban" (chapter 5)

which shows the allusion of Caliban from The Tempest, which is written by Shakespeare. In addition, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting Hamlet, a privileged character who impels his potential suitor (Ophelia) to suicide, and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge. There are the similar characters in the novel. Sibyl refers to Ophelia and James refers to Laertes.

</br>
Although The picture of Dorian Gray is a outstandning novel, as I said preveiously, it is not accepted by Victorians. Daily Chronicle, the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains "one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it."
### Evidence of Aestheticism
>"Good artists simply exist in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating."

This quote shows how Lord Henry shares his ideas about artists to Dorian. He explains his idea about aestheticism, and eventually leads him into hedonistism. He thinks that a intersting person cannot be an artist becuase artists can only sacrifice every other things in order to create art. And this is the same idea as "art for art's sake"
</br>
</br></br>
</br>
>I am so glad that you have never done anything—never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets.

This quote is also stated by Henry. He says that Dorian puts all of himself into living well and enjoying life which is the right thing. <b>Because what Dorian experience will effect the picture instead of himself, when he enjoys his life, he is also "creating an art". If Dorian had tried to do anything else, he could not have been as fully committed to his way of living.</b>
