We are going to discuss three different forms of texts which are written by one brilliant writer.</p>\n<!-- end -->\n<h2>What is Aestheticism?</h2>\n<p>There are many different types of aestheticism, but here we are introducing the one which is an artistic movement during the 19th century. Aestheticism has one simple idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Art for art’s sake</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The follower of aestheticism is called <b>“aesthete”</b> <br/>\nThey believe that the only purpose of creating art is to serve its enjoyment.<br/>\nIt sounds fair enough. However, now we are introducing other terms: </p>\n<h3>Victorian era &#x26; Fin De Siècle</h3>\n<p>The victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria’s reign, from 1837 to 1901. Fin De Siècle means “the end of the century” in french. Becasue of the background of Victorian fin de siècle (The combination of Victorian era &#x26; Fin De Siècle), aestheticism is a pretty revolutionary idea. <br/></p>\n<p>The reason is that the entire Victorian era is about self-improvement. With the rise of the middle class and aristocracy, the Victorians believed industriousness and commitment were all young people need to succeed in Europe. The idea of aestheticism is opposite from their opinion because aestheticism rejects “improving art”.</p>\n<h2>When did aestheticism start?</h2>\n<p>Aestheticism was built upon the idea from late 18th-century German Romantic philosophers. They believed that “art’s value lies not in its usefulness but its beauty and in the pleasure it gives.”Aestheticism originated in 1860s England with a radical group of artists and designers, including William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.<br/></p>\n<h2>Oscar Wilde</h2>\n<p>All three texts are written by Oscar Wilde. He was one of the most popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is also the most famous aesthete because of his well-known novel and script. If you go back to the top of the article and look at the picture you can see the person is Oscar Wilde. </p>\n<h1>Texts</h1>\n<h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/X9G49bi.png%20=100x100\"></p>\n<p>This <b>novel</b> was published in July 1890. It is the most famous novel which is about aestheticism. It is also recognized as a classic of gothic literature. The novel shows how Dorian Gray was enthralled by the aristocrat’s hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. From here, we can see the evidence of the Aestheticism element. Dorian Gray has a paint that shows his beauty. He exchanges his soul to the person in the picture, so all the changes of him will show on the picture instead of him in real life. Dorian Gray was temped by Lord Henry, and while he fell into hedonism, his soul becomes an ugly monster in the paint. Wilde said that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”[The Picture of Dorian Gray] contains much of me in it — Basil Hallward is what I think I am; Lord Henry, what the world thinks me; Dorian is what I would like to be — in other ages, perhaps.” - Wilde,1894</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The novel also has allusions to Faust. In both the legend of Faust and in The Picture of Dorian Gray, a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. And in chapter 5 of the novel, says </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban” (chapter 5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which shows the allusion of Caliban from The Tempest, which is written by Shakespeare. In addition, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting Hamlet, a privileged character who impels his potential suitor (Ophelia) to suicide and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge. There are similar characters in the novel. Sibyl refers to Ophelia and James refers to Laertes.\n</br>\n</br></p>\n<h3>Evidence of Aestheticism</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Good artists simply exist in what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are fascinating.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote shows how Lord Henry shares his ideas about artists with Dorian. He explains his idea about aestheticism and eventually leads him into hedonism. He thinks that an interesting person cannot be an artist because artists can only sacrifice every other thing to create art. And this is the same idea as “art for art’s sake”\n</br>\n</br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am so glad that you have never done anything—never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote is also stated by Henry. He says that Dorian puts all of himself into living well and enjoying life which is the right thing. <b>Because what Dorian experiences will affect the picture instead of himself when he enjoys his life, he is also “creating an art”. If Dorian had tried to do anything else, he could not have been as fully committed to his way of living.</b> </p>\n</br>\nAlthough The picture of Dorian Gray is an outstanding novel, as I said previously, it is not accepted by Victorians. Daily Chronicle, the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains \"one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it.\"\n<h2>The Happy Prince</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Apin72A.png%20=100x100\">\n</br>\nThe second text is a <b>short story</b> also written by Oscar Wilde. The story was written for children, which offers its youngest readers numerous aesthetic elements. The story was related to aestheticism. The form of social moral criticism is a satire on the vision of bourgeois utilitarianism and doubts and beliefs on ordinary people in the Victorian era: the relationship between beauty and morality, and the moral code of femininity. Finally, the discourse of utilitarianism and the joy of opposing the study of beauty are combined with the vision of aestheticism, advocating “art for the sake of art”.\n</br>\n</br>\nThe Happy Prince rejects the idea of connecting the pleasure of art and its beauty with happiness. This combination refers to the specific interpretation of the aestheticism made by Pater in his book The Renaissance. Pater suggests that wise men should find their happiness in the enjoyment of the best pleasures of art (191). The Happy Prince also spends his life enjoying pleasure </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall […] everything about me was so beautiful” (Wilde 280)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During his life, the Prince succeeded in ignoring any pain; however, this pain was\nironically imposed upon him when he died as a retribution for having been self-centred.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness” (Wilde 280).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> After he becomes a status, he finally see the poverty and misery of poor lower-class. In addition to the questioning of moral standards in “Happy Prince”, this story also raises a satire aimed at key members of Victorian society. It mocks the bourgeoisie, especially their obsession with assigning any value. For example, one of the Town councillors attempts to extract a benefit from The Happy Prince status.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“‘He is as beautiful as a weathercock,’ remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ‘only not quite so useful,’ he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not” (Wilde 279). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> Finally, the bourgeoisie is being mocked due to their hypocrisy and lack of intelligence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“‘Dear me! How shabby the Happy Prince looks!’ he said. ‘How shabby, indeed!’ cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor” (Wilde 285).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the work above, we can see how Wilde mock the Victorian bourgeoisie using his believe of aesthetism in the story. It also happen in the next text, which is more extragrated. </p>\n<h2>The Importance of Being Earnest</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OqtC3Eh.png%20=100x100\"></p>\n<p>The Importance of Being Earnest is a <b>play</b> also written by Oscar Wilde. It is the first Wilde work that I have enver read. It is been considered as an artistic testament to the values of the aesthetic movement. It was first performed in London on February 14th, 1895, when is described as Victorian fin de siècle. Bergonzi described the term as“applied to a wide range of trivial behavior, provided it was sufficiently perverse or paradoxical or shocking” (19) And that’s why aesthetes applied conscious mode of performance effect to shock others.</p>\n</br>\n</br>\nIn The Importance of Being Earnest, both Jack and Algernon have a double life and identity. Jack creates a brother called \"Earnest\", and Algernon has a fictious friend called \"Bunbury\". When Algernon saw what Jack does, he also joins the acting of Earnest. But while they are acting as a different person, they do not completely abandon their old selves. Instead they both conserve their own personality when being Earnest.\n</br>\n</br>\nAlthough Jack and Algernon are similar in many ways, Algernon is still consider a member the of upper-class aristocracy. \n<ul>\n<li>Morbi sit amet turpis a purus</li>\n<li>\n<p>Etiam tempor ultricies mi</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maecenas auctor enim a volutpat mattis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sed urna justo, scelerisque consectetur pharetra vitae</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nam nec augue vel nisl placerat faucibus.
